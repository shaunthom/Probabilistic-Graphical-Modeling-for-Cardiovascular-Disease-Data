# Probabilistic-Graphical-Modeling-for-Cardiovascular-Disease-Data
The provided R code utilizes packages for probabilistic graphical modeling and Bayesian networks. 
It starts by inferring a Bayesian network structure from a dataset related to cardiovascular disease and visualizing it. It also imposes constraints on the network's edges based on predefined blocks and visualizes the constrained network. It proceeds to set evidence for specific nodes in the network, retrieve the set evidence, and fit a Bayesian network to the data. Finally, we calculate and prints a revised probability for a specific event (CAD being "Yes") given new evidence (values for "QWave" and "AMI" nodes) using conditional probability queries. I have showcasen operations involving Bayesian networks, structure learning, evidence handling, and probabilistic inference.
